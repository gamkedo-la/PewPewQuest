design notes for map layout / game progression

player starts with no offensive abilities

    bugs are dumb, can be led into barriers to kill
    -all enemies can be damaged by shrapnel and friendly fire (except for scrappers)

    various puzzle rooms involving leading bugs into barriers
    a bug dying by barrier contact increases player score
    
    saber protected on all sides by energy barriers
    saber is not a meta-item

        keys in rooms with bugs in them

        bats not introduced until after player may have obtained saber

    destructible terrain introduced in rooms with turret enemy

        player sees that purple terrain tiles can be destroyed by enemy fire
        
        hint at seeking out a gun

    gun is found, but is meta-item already damaged by tile-eaters

    introduce tile eaters
        lead player into areas with static glitch tiles
        gun found in open combat space with multiple tile-eaters
        defeat tile eaters with saber

    introduce dark labyrinth areas
        dark areas will surround the chalice meta-item area. 
        dark bug: same as bug but nearly invisible. can only be destroyed by flashlight area of influence. 
        areas not impossible without flashlight but very difficult without full health

    introduce flashlight
        flashlight seen in void surrounded by destructible terrain
        outer perimeter of destructible terrain has been scrapped into glitch, so is inpenetrable without destroying some tile eaters
        dual use for flashlight?
