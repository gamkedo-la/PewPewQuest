Things I want to learn/tackle in this game:
    ray collisions / rotated collisions, "non tile" / "non AABB" collisions and response
    procedural character animation
        walks with multiple legs
            bipedal
            quadruped/spider
            dynamic number of limbs
    complex child/parent relationships, multi-sprite entities (bosses/big characters)
    complex-looking enemy behavior using sensors
    an elegant 2.5d solution with proper draw sorting
        "tall tiles" ?
fun feature ideas:
    tilemap-based objects
        use small 4px or 8x tilemap designs as objects in game
    some kind of dynamic lighting
        pre-rendered light/dark copies of tilesheet graphics
    dynamic tilemap effects
    pre-rendered sprite rotations ? 




top-down shooter roguelike where you can pilot multiple machines in the world
    abandon them when damaged or need a smaller one to proceed
    some roll, some walk, will have to swap to traverse some terrains / fit in tight spaces

a hunter/gatherer roguelike with a day/night cycle.  At night monsters come to eat you.
    single-map game, but big enough for a scrolling camera
    arcade-like loop, less content creation, more iteration on fun-ness
    See pico8 fisher game

a peaceful big-world exploration walkabout with lots of unique collectibles
    multiple creature types, all peaceful
    opportunity to code big multi-page inventory UI
    crafting? -scope
